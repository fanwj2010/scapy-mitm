# scapy-mitm
Small python script using Scapy to do ARP poisoning and redirection of IP addresses using Linux's built in Iptables to perform a MITM attack. Currently, this has had *limited testing*, meaning beware if it doesn't work. Also, this flushes rules for your Iptable config, so be careful if you care about that sort of thing. FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The author takes no responsibility for any use of this software, and it is most likely illegal to use this on networks you do not own. Cheers, Maxwell. Let me know if anything is broken though mbland@eng.ucsd.edu or an issue posted to this repo.
